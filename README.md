# wp1_2_roast
Analysis of electric field magnitudes (wp2a dataset) and correlation analysis with Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) results.

The goal of these analyses is to establish whether there is a relationship between single-subject electric field magnitudes
generated with the ROAST pipeline and changes in effective connectivity within the motor network as defined using DCM and parametric empirical bayes.
